# Agar.io remake
This is a node export of my single player version of Agar.io. The original is [here](https://github.com/keithhopkins/game-clone).

## Current goals

* Add socket.io
* Separate client side game logic from server side game logic
* Add option to play multiplayer or single player
* Deploy to Heroku
* Update AI to use a behavior tree instead of a finite state machine
* Have the canvas be a viewport of a large map
